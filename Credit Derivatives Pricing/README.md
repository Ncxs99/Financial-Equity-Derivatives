### Credit Derivatives Pricing

This section is dedicated to the pricing of credit derivatives, with a primary focus on synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). We have implemented robust methods for pricing these instruments using both Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo simulations, providing flexibility and precision in modeling complex credit structures.

#### Current Focus:
- **Synthetic CDOs Pricing:**
  - **Monte Carlo Methods:** These are used to simulate the distribution of losses and estimate the fair value of various tranches within a synthetic CDO structure.
  - **Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods:** By employing variance reduction techniques and low-discrepancy sequences (such as Halton, Sobol, and Kakutani), we improve the efficiency and accuracy of the pricing process.

#### Future Developments:
- This section is designed with extensibility in mind. In future updates, we plan to incorporate additional methods and tools for pricing other types of credit derivatives, expanding the scope and utility of this library.

Whether you are a quantitative analyst, financial engineer, or researcher, this section offers the foundational tools necessary for advanced credit derivatives pricing, with ongoing enhancements to come.
