### Bond Pricing

This section is dedicated to the pricing of bonds and the calculation of related interest rates. We focus on various aspects of bond valuation and yield curve analysis to provide comprehensive tools for fixed-income securities.

#### Key Features:

1. **Discounting and Accumulation Functions:**
   - **Discounting Function:** Calculates the present value of future cash flows.
   - **Accumulation Function:** Determines the future value of a present amount, considering interest compounding.

2. **Zero-Coupon Bond Calculations:**
   - **Zero-Coupon Bond Price:** Computes the price of bonds that do not pay periodic interest.
   - **Zero-Coupon Rate:** Calculates the yield on zero-coupon bonds.
   - **Zero-Coupon Forward:** Determines the future price of zero-coupon bonds.
   - **Zero-Coupon Forward Rate:** Computes the implied interest rate for zero-coupon bonds over a specific period.
   - **BIS Method:** Applies a new approach for calculating zero-coupon forward rates, incorporating advanced techniques.

3. **Bond Pricing Metrics:**
   - **Bond Pricing:** Implements various methods to price bonds, including those with coupon payments.
   - **Actuarial Rate of Bond:** Calculates the internal rate of return on bonds.
   - **Bond Duration:** Measures the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates.
   - **Bond Convexity:** Assesses the curvature in the bond price-yield curve, providing insights into interest rate risk.

4. **Practical Application - VASICEK:**
   - **Experience and Variance:** Analyzes the performance and variability of bond pricing models using VASICEK.
   - **Infinite Rate and Volatility:** Calculates the rate and volatility of zero-coupon bonds in the VASICEK context.
   - **Sensitivity Analysis:** Evaluates the sensitivity of zero-coupon bonds to various factors using VASICEK.
   - **Visualization:** Provides case studies and visual representations to illustrate the practical application of bond pricing techniques.
