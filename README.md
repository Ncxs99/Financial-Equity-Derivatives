### Description 

This repository is dedicated to the development of Python libraries focused on the pricing of financial derivatives. The primary objective is to build robust, efficient, and flexible tools that can be utilized for pricing a wide range of derivative products.

**Key Goals:**

1. **Understanding Asset Classes Derivatives:** The project aims to deepen our understanding of equity derivatives, including options, futures, and other complex financial instruments. By dissecting the mathematical models and financial theories behind these products, we seek to offer comprehensive pricing solutions.

2. **Pricing Methodologies:** We will explore and implement various pricing methodologies commonly used in the financial industry. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - **Black-Scholes Model:** A foundational model for pricing European options and understanding market dynamics.
   - **Monte Carlo Simulations:** A versatile method for pricing complex derivatives and assessing risk through stochastic processes.
   - **Finite Difference Methods:** Numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that arise in pricing derivative products.

3. **Python Implementation:** The libraries will be developed in Python, leveraging its extensive ecosystem of financial and numerical tools. The goal is to create reusable and well-documented code that can be easily integrated into larger financial systems or used for academic research.

This project is intended for quantitative analysts, financial engineers, and developers interested in the intricacies of derivative pricing. Whether you're looking to better understand the mathematics of pricing models or seeking practical implementations, this repository aims to be a valuable resource.
